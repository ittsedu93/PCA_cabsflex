# PCA_cabsflex

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on protein flexibility data generated with **CABS-Flex 3.0**.  

The script helps to explore major conformational changes and motions derived from the simulation output.

## Contents
- `PCAgraf.ipynb` â†’ Notebook with PCA analysis of CABS-Flex results.

## Usage
Open the notebook in **Jupyter Lab** or **Jupyter Notebook**, load the output files from **CABS-Flex 3.0**, and run the cells to generate PCA plots and interpret protein motions.
